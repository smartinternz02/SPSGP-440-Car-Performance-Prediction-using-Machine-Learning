Project Description:

Predicting the performance level of cars is an important and interesting problem. The main goal is to predict the performance of the car to improve the certain behavior of the vehicle. This can significantly help to improve the system's fuel consumption and increase efficiency.

The performance analysis of the car is based on the engine type, no of engine cylinders, fuel type, and horsepower, etc. These are the factors on which the health of the car can be predicted. It is an on-going process of obtaining, researching, analyzing, and recording the health based on the above three factors. The performance objectives like mileage, dependability, flexibility, and cost can be grouped together to play a vital role in the prediction engine and engine management system. This approach is a very important step towards understanding the vehicle's performance.
